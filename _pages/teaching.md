<!-- # Teaching and Mentorship

## Teaching -->

I'm very passionate about STEM education and pedagogical practices, especially as they relate to the math hesitant and to traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences. My teaching statement and sample course materials are available on request.

In May 2022, I earned a Certificate of College Teaching Preparation from the Yale University Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning, which also meets the requirements for CIRTL Associate.  And, to the end of better conveying complex material to learners (and the public in an outreach capacity), I earned a Certificate in Science Communication through the Northwestern University Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics SCOPE program in June 2022 and a Kavli SciComm Essentials Certificate from the Kavli Foundation in December 2023.

I also maintain [astroteaching.github.io](https://astroteaching.github.io){:target = "_blank"}, where I have aggregated various open source course materials and visualizations/resources to make it easier for other instructors to find. Please feel free to e-mail me if you'd like to see something added!

I recently led an effort by more than 30 (!!) women to create a primer on astrophysics for students interested in pursuing the field. An online version of that book, *Astronomy as a Field: A Guide for Aspiring Astrophysicists*, is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04041){:target="_blank"}.


Below is a list of my specific teaching involvements (past + present); evaluations are linked where available.

#### University of Chicago

I am a Graduate Fellow of the Chicago Center for Teaching & Learning. As a Fellow, I am charged with developing and delivering instruction and programming related to teaching and pedagogy to other early career scholars at the University of Chicago.

# Mentorship

I'm also very interested in good mentorship practices. I have worked with a number of high school students, both through my research involvements in graduate school and through [Polygence](https://www.polygence.org){:target="_blank"}. 

My past students are listed below. If you are a high schooler interested in working with me through Polygence, just make sure to list me as your preference for mentor when you go through the application process.

I'm sometimes approached by students for informational interviews; please do reach out if you're interested in learning more about my research or trajectory. One of the most informative things I did as an undergraduate (which I wish I had done even sooner) was cold email astrophysicists at various career stages to chat about their work and path to/through science.
