<!-- # Teaching and Mentorship

## Teaching -->

I'm very passionate about STEM education and pedagogical practices, especially as they relate to the math hesitant and to traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences. My teaching statement and sample course materials are available on request.

In May 2022, I earned a Certificate of College Teaching Preparation from the Yale University Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning, which also meets the requirements for CIRTL Associate.  And, to the end of better conveying complex material to learners (and the public in an outreach capacity), I earned a Certificate in Science Communication through the Northwestern University Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics SCOPE program in June 2022 and a Kavli SciComm Essentials Certificate from the Kavli Foundation in December 2023.

I also maintain [astroteaching.github.io](https://astroteaching.github.io){:target = "_blank"}, where I have aggregated various open source course materials and visualizations/resources to make it easier for other instructors to find. Please feel free to e-mail me if you'd like to see something added!

I recently created a primer on astrophysics for students interested in pursuing the field, involving more than 30 (!!) women in the effort. An online version of that book, *Astronomy as a Field: A Guide for Aspiring Astrophysicists*, is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04041){:target="_blank"}.


Below is a list of my specific teaching involvements (past + present); evaluations are linked where available.

# Mentorship

I'm also very interested in good mentorship practices. My current + past students are listed below. 

I'm sometimes approached by students for informational interviews; please do reach out if you're interested in learning more about my research or trajectory. One of the most informative things I did as an undergraduate (which I wish I had done even sooner) was cold email astrophysicists at various career stages to chat about their work and path to/through science.

### University of Chicago
- Catherine Mah (Hong Kong University Physics '25, exchange student at UChicago) -- Recovering photometry and structural properties for a diverse sample of dwarf galaxies; work conducted in the Chen group


I have also worked with a number of high school students, both through my research involvements in graduate school and through [Polygence](https://www.polygence.org){:target="_blank"}. If you are a high schooler interested in working with me through Polygence, just make sure to list me as your preference for mentor when you go through the application process.
