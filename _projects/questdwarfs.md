<!-- The **Q**uasars to **U**nderstand **E**nvironments and **ST**ar formation in/around **Dwarfs** project leverages incredible multiwavelength data (including FUV spectra along QSO sightlines, optical spectra, and ground- and space-based photometry) to connect the chemical and physical properties of a diverse sample of dwarf galaxies. We observe the connections between the galaxies' larger environments, circumgalactic medium, and star formation, enabling detailed and holistic study of the baryon cycle in low mass galaxies (between \~a million and a billion solar masses). Given the wealth of archival data available for these dwarfs (in addition to newly taken observations), we are able to characterize the stellar populations, interstellar medium, and circumgalactic medium of the galaxies in our sample. -->
