So many people generously make their course materials publicly available. In order to enable more consistent access to those materials, I started, and maintain, [astroteaching.github.io](https://astroteaching.github.io){:target="_blank"}.

Resources are categorized by broad topic, roughly broken out by either subfield or common course content.

If you would like to see something added to the site, please open an [issue](https://github.com/astroteaching/astroteaching.github.io/issues){:target="_blank"} or email me directly.
